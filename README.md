# MVP-
A simple app to gather thoughts


Project Name

- "Brain Eater"

Heading

- a simple app to log a daily thought or lesson learned

Sub-Heading

- For anyone who would like to keep track of what they are learning each day

Summary

- "Brain Eater" allows the user to log, in a database, a single lesson or thpought which they have learned on that day.  Users should be able to view a log of their previous daily lessons or thoughts. A 'feed me my wisdom' button will return a random lesson learned from their own history.  A 'feed me the wisdom of another' button will return a random lesson from another user.  A 'knowledge vomit!' button will return all lessons from all users.  Lessons will include a 'learned by' property and  date along with the lessons (brief) content. 

Problem

- In a high stress environment I often cannot remember what I did the day before or what I did, or was supposed to learn from it.  I've never been a journal keeper because the scope of an entry just seems too large and when I sit down to enter something I usually spend far too long trying to figure out what to write before giving up and going to sleep.

Solution

- "Brain Eater" will attempt to solve this problem by boiling down the entry to a very simple and straigth forward question, "what did you learn today?".
